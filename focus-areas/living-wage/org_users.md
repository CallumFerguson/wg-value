# Organizational Users

## 1. Description
Organizations engage in open source projects through use and contributions. This metric is a list of the organizations that use and contribute to an open source project.

## 2. Use Cases
In a quest to earn a living wage, workers may be interested in knowing which
projects are used by large organizations. The worker can use the Organizational Users metric to discover which repos are used by large organizations, possibly requiring support services.

## 3. Formula

Base metrics include:
- number of issues created by org users
- number of PRs created by org users

## 4. Sample Filter and Visualization

We envision a time-series visualization that shows a line chart of monthly
org participation across a portfolio of repos.

## 5. Sample Implementation

TBD

## 6. Known Implementations

1. Augur

## 7. Test Cases (Examples)
