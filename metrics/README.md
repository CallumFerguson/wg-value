## Metrics for Value Working Group

Groups within the CHAOSS project each have their own objectives in mind. In the Value group, our aim is focus on measurements that result in funding community work. 

## Intended audience 

All metrics are intended to be used by individuals looking to continue to fund community work. This includes individuals who are in a Open Source Program Office (OSPO), Developer Relations (DevRel), or run an influencer program (ex. Microsoft MVP).

This audience extends to those who work in organizations with pre-defined funding paths (like an events team in marketing), but they do not wish to justify their work using traditional means (thinking of events, that would mean ignoring "lead generation"). 

## Metric guidelines

"Community work" is left open to self-selection. Some scenarios those working in Community could consider include: 

- Can I secure funding to start an event without focusing on lead generation? 
- Can I secure funding to sponsor or be sponsored as an event organizer?
- How do I quantify the value of me attending (one or more) conferences? 
- How do I justify to my executive sponsor to fund my community-oriented team?
- How did I receive funding from VCs for a community-oriented startup? 

### Advice for useful metrics 

The intention is to show that metrics positioned as relative values to other investments can be infinitely more effective than arguing “it’s the right thing to do for our Community.” With that in mind: 

- Is the metric interesting to my exective sponsor or boss's boss? If not, it's more likely aligned to [another working group](https://github.com/chaoss/metrics#goals-of-chaoss-metrics).
- Is the metric effective on its own (like a vanity metric) or as a comparison over time or both? 
- Is the metric most effective comparing to itself or to competitors? 
- Is the metric effective in a certain portion of an organizational chart in a corporation (Marketing, Product, Engineering, Human Resources)? If so, note that.
